# ESP32-Audio-Kit & hvcc

This repo demonstrates a single file solution for running hvcc sources on the [ESP32-Audio-Kit](https://nl.aliexpress.com/af/ESP32%25252dAudio%25252dKit.html), inspired by the [Faust ESP32 architecture example](https://faust.grame.fr/doc/tutorials/#dsp-on-the-esp32-with-faust). The hvcc compiler leverages the use of (a subset of) puredata operators on the cheap and fast esp32 uprocessor. The ESP32-Audio-Kit provides a complete audio development platform with a very reasonable pricetag.
