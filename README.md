# ESP32-Audio-Kit & hvcc

This repo demonstrates a single file solution for running hvcc sources on the ESP32-Audio-Kit, very much inspired by the Faust ESP32 architecture. The hvcc compiler leverages the use of (a subset of) puredata operators on the cheap and fast esp32 uprocessor. The ESP32-Audio-Kit provides a complete audio development platform with a very reasonable pricetag.
